# Data Visualization Repository

This repository contains various data visualization examples, each implemented in its respective directory:

- **Bar Chart**: Demonstrates the creation of bar charts to compare categorical data.
- **Choropleth Map**: Illustrates the use of choropleth maps for representing data across geographical regions.
- **Heat Map**: Shows how to create heat maps to visualize data density or intensity.
- **Scatter Plot**: Provides examples of scatter plots for analyzing relationships between variables.
- **Treemap**: Displays hierarchical data using nested rectangles.

Each directory includes the necessary code and data to generate the corresponding visualization.

## Getting Started

To explore these visualizations:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andrei2308/Data-visualisation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the desired visualization directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Data-visualisation/[Visualization-Directory]
   ```

3. **Follow the instructions in the directory's README or comments to run the visualization**.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary software and libraries installed to run the visualizations. Specific requirements are provided within each directory.
